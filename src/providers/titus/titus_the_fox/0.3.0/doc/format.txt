This describes the format of the LEVEL?.SQZ files, after uncompressing them.

LEVELA.SQZ is not a level file but a picture. The format of the other files is as follows:

(all numbers are decimal)

Offset	Size in bytes	What it is
--------------------------------------------------------------
0	256*LevelSize	Level tile map
x-32768	256*128		Tile bitmaps for each of the 256 tiles
x	256		Horizontal flags for each tile
x+256	256		Floor flags for each tile
x+512	256		Ceiling flags for each tile
x+768	40*6		Objects
x+1008	2		Vertical scrolling limit - 12
x+1010	2		X-coordinate of entrance
x+1012	2		Y-coordinate of entrance
x+1014	50*26		Enemies
x+2314	100*4		Bonuses
x+2714	2		Horizontal scrolling limit - 20
x+2716	20*7		Gates
x+2856	10*20		Elevators
x+3056	2		X-coordinate of exit
x+3058	2		Y-coordinate of exit

where	LevelSize = (filesize - 35828) / 256
and	x = 256*LevelSize + 32768


Sprite number fields mentioned below contain several values:
Bit	What it is
------------------
0..12	Sprite number
13	Supporting
14	Flash (internal use only)
15	If set, sprite is horizontally flipped

Sprites have their origin at the center pixel of the bottom line; to convert level-file coords to regular (0, 0) origin do:
(SpriteX, SpriteY) = (FileX - SpriteWidth/2, FileY - SpriteHeight)
This does not apply to Elevator sprites however, which have regular (0, 0) origin already.

A detailed description of each item follows:

Level tile map
--------------
Each byte specifies which tile should be at that position. All levels are 256 tiles wide, the height (LevelSize) varies.

Tile bitmaps for each of the 256 tiles
--------------------------------------
Each bitmap is 16 colors, 16*16 pixels and stored in planar format.

Horizontal/floor/ceiling flags for each tile
--------------------------------------------
These specify the behaviour of a tile, i.e. if you can stand on it, if it's a wall, if it kills you or even if it's a bonus.

	Horizontal
	----------
	Valid values are:

	0: no wall
	1: wall
	2: health bonus
	4: level code
	5: padlock bonus
	6: level 14 code

	Floor
	-----
	Valid values are:

	0: no floor
	1: floor
	2: slightly slippery floor
	3: slippery floor
	4: very slippery floor
	5: drop-through (duck and you'll fall through)
	6: ladder
	7: health bonus
	8: deadly (eats most objects; allows objects to bounce, but only the ball remains in rest)
	9: deadly (eats all objects)
	10: deadly (supports all objects)
	11: level code
	12: padlock bonus
	13: level 14 code

	Ceiling
	-------
	If bit 7 is set, this tile and the two following it are cycled in-game.
	Valid values for bit 0..6 are:

	0: no ceiling
	1: ceiling
	2: ladder
	3: padlock bonus
	4: deadly

Objects
-------
There are 40 object records, each of which has this format:

	Offset	Size	What it is
	-----------------------------
	0	2	Sprite number
	2	2	X coordinate
	4	2	Y coordinate

An object record is skipped if Sprite number = FFFF.

Vertical scrolling limit
------------------------
The game will not scroll below this line unless the player actually is below it.
As soon as the player is above the line again, the game scrolls up.

Coordinates of entrance
-----------------------
Here the fun starts.

Enemies
-------
There are 50 enemy records. Some fields have to be set to a particular value upon save; this is indicated by '=='.
Each record has this format:

	Offset	Size	What it is
	-------------------------------------
	0	2	NMI_X: X-coordinate
	2	2	NMI_Y: Y-coordinate
	4	2	Sprite number (add 101 to bits 0..12 to get the actual sprite)
	6	2	Bit 0..12: enemy type (bits 13..15 used internally, should be 0 in the file)
	8	2	NMI_Speed
	10	1	Health: the enemy's health, defaults to 1 for non-boss enemies. Only valid
			if inside an MFL file; else non-boss enemies always have health	1 and boss
			enemy health depends on level number. Default boss health: 2 for level 1,
			4 for level 5 and 10 for the rest. See MFLFORM.TXT.
	12	2	NMI_Power: Enemies' power (determines speed at which you fly away after a hit)
			If this is 0, the enemy doesn't do any harm.
	14	1	== 0

An enemy record is skipped if Sprite number = FFFF.

Enemy type determines the meaning of the remaining bytes:

Most enemy types have a list of eNemy Parameter names after a semicolon in the table above.
These names define parameter groups used for that type; the following list shows
for each parameter group its values, their valid range and a sensible default value.

Unless otherwise indicated, words are signed and bytes unsigned

NPCount2:	NMI_Count2 [B20], default 50

NPPower:	NMI_Power [W12], default 50

NPPowerS:	NMI_PowerS [W15] >= 1, default 15

NPRange:	NMI_Center [W15], default NMI_X - 8
		NMI_Dist [W17] >= 0, default 16

NPSpeed:	NMI_Speed [W8], default 1

NPSpeed2:	NMI_Speed [W8] < 256, default 1

NPYSpeed4:	NMI_YSpeed4 [B19] >= 0 (signed), default 1

NPVZone:	NMI_VZone [B19], default 100
		NPVZoneDown indicates the zone is also below, besides above

NPFreq:		NMI_Freq [B16] >= 10, default 50

NPFreq2:	NMI_Freq2 [B19], default 50

Bonuses
-------
There are 100 bonus records, each of which has this format:

	Offset	Size	What it is
	-----------------------------
	0	1	Bonus tile
	1	1	Tile that replaces the bonus after it's picked up
	2	2	X/Y coordinates

A bonus record is skipped if X = FF and Y = FF.

Only tiles 253-255 can be health bonuses, the other ones' type depends on the tile flags.

Horizontal scrolling limit
--------------------------
The game will not scroll to the right of this line unless the player actually is to the right of it.
When the player is on the left again, the game does not scroll back immediately.

Gates
-----
There are 20 gate records, each of which has this format:

	Offset	Size	What it is
	-----------------------------
	0	2	X/Y coordinates of entrance
	2	2	X/Y coordinates of screen position after passing through a gate
	4	2	X/Y coordinates of exit
	6	1	Scrolling; if this is non-zero, scrolling is disabled after passing through

A gate record is skipped if Y-coordinate of entrance >= LevelSize

Elevators
---------
There are 10 elevator records, each of which has this format:

	Offset	Size	What it is
	-----------------------------
	4	2	Sprite number - 30. Bit 13 (supporting) should be set (before doing -30).
	7	1	Speed (0..7); number of pixels moved per frame
	10	2	Range; every n (>0) frames, reverse the direction
	12	2	X-coordinate
	14	2	Y-coordinate
	16	1	Direction: 0=up, 1=right, 2=down, 3=left

An elevator record is skipped if either Sprite number = FFFF, Speed >= 8, X < -16 or Y < 0.

Coordinates of exit
-------------------
Here the fun ends.
