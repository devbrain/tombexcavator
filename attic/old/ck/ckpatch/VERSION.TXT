Version history of CKPatch
--------------------------

Version 0.9.0 - Third beta release - 26/6/2003

* License is now GPL (was public domain).  Read LICENSE.TXT for more
  details.
* Transparent LZEXE decompression.  CKPatch will now autodetect and
  decompress the game executables if they are still LZEXE-packed, so
  you don't need to use UNLZEXE beforehand.  There are still a few
  minor issues with this feature, please read README.TXT for further
  information.
* Script file parsing code was overhauled.  While the script parser
  in CKPatch v0.5.x worked OK for syntactically correct files, it did
  not handle many kinds of syntax errors gracefully, leading to
  unpredictable behaviour at times.  The parser is now a lot more
  strict, and encourages well-formatted layout.  There are many
  subtle changes to the syntax since CKPatch v0.5.x, so please read
  README.TXT before you get snagged ;)
* Error messages are more informative, and include a line of context
  to highlight the actual word that is causing the error.
* Fixed the bug where the %version command argument was being
  truncated to 3 characters while comparing, causing Keen 1-3 v1.31 to
  not be recognised. Thanks to Andrew Durdin for reporting this bug.
* Added optional seek and length parameters to %patchfile command.
* Added %level.file, %egahead, %egasprit and %egalatch commands for
  Keen 1-3.  These allow individual levels and graphics to be
  replaced respectively.  The Keen 1-3 file redirector has been
  rewritten to allow the EGAHEAD, EGASPRIT and EGALATCH files and up
  to 24 level files to be replaced.
* Added %ckmhead.obj command for loading the CKxMHEAD.OBJ file
  generated by TED5 without having to modify it.
* The source code has been cleaned up significantly, and is
  commented at a professional quality level.  This is to encourage
  others to contribute and/or maintain and help improve CKPatch.
* Size limits to the AUDIOHED, EGAHEAD, MAPHEAD, AUDIODCT and EGADICT
  resources have been implemented to prevent files that have excess
  bytes from overwriting neighbouring resources.
* The code has been optimised for size, with some data structures
  being made global to produce tigher code and reduce stack usage.
  Consequently CKPatch has been able to take on these new features
  with only a slight overall increase in the memory footprint.
* The documentation in CKPATCH.TXT has been rewritten, and is now
  organised into numbered sections.  A quick FAQ has also been
  provided for those of you who, despite my best efforts, still
  neglect to read the documentation :)

Version 0.5.1 - Second beta release - 6/12/2001

* Added support for Keen 1-3 v1.31 and Keen 6 v1.4.
  Thanks to Andrew Durdin for the information.
* Added LICENSE.TXT to binary/source packages

  Oops, sorry to those involved ;)
