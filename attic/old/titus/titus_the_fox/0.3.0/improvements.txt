This is just a "wish list" what improvements I would like to make in OpenTitus, to make really custom levels.

Wish {
  Custom sprite animations (haven't started with animating yet)
  Custom tile count (would quadruple tilemap size if pointers is used, "only" double if short int is used in the same way as chars are used by now)
  Custom tile animation (haven't started with animating yet)
} Requires planning


Wish {
  Support for multiple scroll limits
  Animated elevators (haven't started with animating yet)
} Requires struct update


Wish {
  Support for width != 256
  height > 256
  colour depth > 16 colours
  custom sprite count
  custom sprite sizes
  custom background tile sizes
} struct okay, needs a custom file format and load function
