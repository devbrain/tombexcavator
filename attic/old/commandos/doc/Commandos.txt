The WARGAME.DIR file has directory entries at the start of the
file which are 44 bytes long each. The format of these is:

Name	-	32 chars (actually 8.3 but they're null terminated with some padding after)
type	-	byte
		0x01 is a directory marker
		0xFF is an end of directory marker
		anything else seems to be a file.
padding -	3 bytes just ignore
size	-	unsigned long
		the size of the file (should be 0 for directories and 0xFFFF
		for end of directory markers)
offset	-	unsigned long
		files: the offset from the start of the file to the specified file
		directories: offset to the first entry in the directory
		end of directory: should be 0xFFFF
