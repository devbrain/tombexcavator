{The planet of Zile still holds an attack force of tremendous power.  The
final war fleets have been detected under the Zilion ocean, where the giant
command dome is thought to be well protected.}

{One final mission should end the Zilion war effort for good.  If you fail,
the tide will turn without mercy against your people, and Ytima will become
a slave planet without hope.}

{As you plunge through the ocean's surface this single thought drives you
to succeed...}
