 Most of the information about VQA files is to be credited to Aaron Glover
 (arn@ibm.net). I am only rewriting his document because I found out some
 new info on these files and also because some of the facts in his document
 weren't accurate.
 I'd like to thank Marcelo Volmaro for supplying me with some Lands of Lore 2 
 VQAs that my player was having trouble with and allowing me to further refine
 this spec.


DESCRIPTION:
 The *.VQA files are Westwood Studios' own proprietary file format for storing
 movies, where fairly high compression is required in order to
 store many of them on a single CD.

 The format is used in a number of Westwood games with different modifications.
 It seems that with every new game release they also change something in the
 way the movies are compressed. This is a downside resulting in a large number
 of cases a video player must support in order to be able to play every file.

 The compression technique used in these movies is called Vector Quantization,
 and I suppose that's where the files got their name from. I won't describe
 this compression scheme in detail, instead I will try to explain how to view
 these movies.

NOTE #1: This document only applies to VQA files in the original C&C and 
         C&C: Red Alert (version 2) as well as
         Legend of Kyrandia III : Malcolm's Revenge (version 1).
         It DOES NOT apply to the HiColor VQAs found in Westwood's newer
         games. They use a somewhat different approach to compressing video
         data (I will provide some facts about their sound stream, though).
         Look at my other document (HC-VQA.TXT) for a description
         of the HiColor VQA movies.

NOTE #2: Throughout the document, I will assume that:
         CHAR is 1 byte in size, unsigned,
         SHORT is 2 bytes in size, unsigned,
         LONG is 4 bytes in size.

 Each VQA file is comprised of a series of chunks. A chunk can contain
 other sub-chunks nested in it. Every chunk has a 4 letter ID (all uppercase
 letters) and a LONG written using Motorola byte ordering system (first
 comes the Most Significant Byte), unlike the usual Intel system (Least
 Significant Byte first).

 For example, if you had a value 0x12345678 in hexadecimal, using the Intel
 notation it would be written as 78 56 34 12, while using Motorola's 
 12 34 56 78.

NOTE: Some chunk IDs start with a NULL byte (0x00) because of reasons
      that will become apparent later. You should just skip this byte
      and assume the next 4 letters hold the chunk ID.

 Following the chunk header is the chunk data.

 Here is a scheme of a typical VQA file (nested chunks are indented):

 FORM
   VQHD
   FINF       <-  Frame data positions
   SND?    \  <-  First sound chunk, contains 1/2 second of sound
   SND?     |     <- Contains 1 frame's worth of sound
   VQFR     |     <- Contains various video data chunks
     CBF?   | 1st frame data
     CBP?   |
     CPL?   |
     VPT?  /
   SND?    \
   VQFR     | 2nd frame data
     CBP?   |
     VPT?  /
   SND?    \
   VQFR     | 3rd frame data
     CBP?   |
     VPT?  /
 . . .

NOTE: There can also be some other chunks (i.e. PINF, PINH, SN2J) included,
      but they are not relevant (?!) for viewing the movie, so they can
      easily be skipped.

FORM chunk:
~~~~~~~~~~~
 This chunk is the main chunk, containing all other chunks.
 In case of version 2 and 3 movies, its size is actually the size of the
 entire file minus the size of the chunk header (8 bytes). Version 1 movies
 seem to have this set to the length of the header VQHD + FINF chunk.

 Immediately after the chunk's header, a 4-character signature,
 "WVQA" is located. Then come all the other chunks.

VQHD chunk ("VQa HeaDer" ???):
~~~~~~~~~~~
 This is the header chunk, containing vital information about the movie.
 Its size is always 42 bytes.
 The information is structured like this:

 struct VQAHeader
 {
  short  Version;       /* VQA version number                         */
  short  Flags;         /* VQA flags                                  */
  short  NumFrames;     /* Number of frames                           */
  short  Width;         /* Movie width (pixels)                       */
  short  Height;        /* Movie height (pixels)                      */
  char   BlockW;        /* Width of each image block (pixels)         */
  char   BlockH;        /* Height of each image block (pixels)        */
  char   FrameRate;     /* Frame rate of the VQA                      */
  char   CBParts;       /* How many images use the same lookup table  */
  short  Colors;        /* Maximum number of colors used in VQA       */
  short  MaxBlocks;     /* Maximum number of image blocks             */
  long   Unknown1;      /* Always 0 ???                               */
  short  Unknown2;      /* Some kind of size ???                      */
  short  Freq;          /* Sound sampling frequency                   */
  char   Channels;      /* Number of sound channels                   */
  char   Bits;          /* Sound resolution                           */
  long   Unknown3;      /* Always 0 ???                               */
  short  Unknown4;      /* 0 in old VQAs, 4 in HiColor ones ???       */
  long   MaxCBFZSize;   /* 0 in old VQAs, max. CBFZ size in HiColor   */
  long   Unknown5;      /* Always 0 ???                               */
 }


 * Version denotes the VQA version. Valid values are:
   1 - First VQAs, used only in Legend of Kyrandia III.
   2 - Used in C&C, Red Alert, Lands of Lore II, Dune 2000.
   3 - Lands of Lore III (?), Blade Runner (?), Nox and Tiberian Sun.
       These VQAs are HiColor (15 bit).

 * Flags most probably contain some flags. I only know that bit 0 (LSB)
   denotes whether the VQA has a soundtrack or not.
   (1 = Has sound, 0 = No sound)
   
 * Width is usually 320, Height is usually 156 or 200 although one movie in
   Red Alert is 640x400 in size (the start movie for the Win95 version).

 Each frame of a VQA movie is comprised of a series of blocks that are
 BlockW pixels in width and BlockH pixels in height. Imagine the frame
 is a mosaic with the blocks being 'pieces' that make up the frame.

 * BlockW is the width and BlockH is the height of each screen block.
   In VQAs version 2 (and perhaps 1) the blocks are usually 4x2.

 * FrameRate is always 15 in C&C and RA and seems to be 10 in LoK III.

 * CBParts denotes how many frames use the same lookup table. It also
   implies how many parts the new block lookup table is split into.
   In C&C and RA it is always 8.

 * Colors indicates the maximum number of colors used by the VQA.
   The HiColor VQAs have this set to 0, while the old movies have
   256 or less in here.

 * Freq is usually 22050 Hz. Note that version 1 movies can have this set 
   to 0 Hz. In that case, you should use 22050 Hz.

 * Channels specifies the number of sound channels, i.e. is the sound
   mono or stereo. Channels=1 -> sound is mono, Channels=2 -> stereo.
   C&C and RA almost always use mono sound. 
   Version 1 can have this set to 0, but you should use 1 (mono sound).
   The majority of Tiberian Sun movies use stereo sound instead.
 
 * Bits indicates whether the sound is 8 bit or 16 bit.
   Bits=8 -> 8 bit sound, Bits=16 -> 16 bit sound (surprise! :). 
   The Legend of Kyrandia III: Malcolm's Revenge uses 8 bits where
   C&C, RA, TS, Dune 2000, Lands of Lore III use 16 bits.
   Note, again, that version 1 of the VQAs can have this set to 0 in
   which case 8 bits are assumed.

 * MaxCBFZSize is a new entry, specific to the HiColor VQAs. It tells
   you the size of the largest CBFZ chunk, in bytes.

 Following the chunk data are the sub-chunks.

FINF chunk ("Frame INFormation" ???):
~~~~~~~~~~~
 This chunk contains the positions (absolute from the start of the VQA)
 of data for every frame.
 That means that it points to the SND? chunk associated with that frame,
 which is followed by a VQFR chunk containing frame's video data.

 The positions are given as LONGs which are in normal Intel byte order.

 NOTE: Some frame positions are 0x40000000 too large. This is a flag
       indicating those frames contain a new color palette. To get the
       actual positions, you should subtract 0x40000000 from the values.

 NOTE #2: To get the actual position of the frame data you have to multiply
          the value by 2. This is why some chunk IDs start with 0x00. Since
          you multiply by 2, you can't get an odd chunk position so if the
          chunk position would normally be odd, a 0x00 is inserted to make
          it even.

SND? chunk ("SouND" ???):     
~~~~~~~~~~~
 These chunks contain the sound data for the movie. The last byte of the ID
 can be either '0', '1' or '2' so the actual IDs would be "SND0", "SND1"
 and "SND2". 
 In VQAs version 1 (Legend of Kyrandia 3) there are NumFrames sound chunks.
 Old 8 bit VQA movies of version 2 have NumFrames+1 sound chunks.
 Note, however, that Dune2000 movies, which are also version 2, but HiColor
 have NumFrames sound chunks, instead.
 Version 3 movies also have NumFrames sound chunks.

 In case of the old, 8 bit VQAs, the first chunk contains half a second
 (ver. 2) or more (ver. 1) of the wave data, in all (?) the HiColor movies
 the first chunk contains exactly the amount of sound required for one
 frame of the movie. The downside is this requires a somewhat more advanced 
 buffering technique on the side of the player in order to allow smooth 
 playback.

 SND0 chunk:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~
  This one contains the raw 8 or 16 bit PCM wave data. If the data is
  8 bit, the sound is unsigned and if it is 16 bit, the samples are
  signed.

 SND1 chunk:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~
  It contains 8 bit sound compressed using Westwood's own
  proprietary ADPCM algorithm. The chunk has a 4 byte header:

  struct SND1Header
  {
   short OutSize;
   short Size;
  }

  These values are needed for the decoding algoritm (see APPENDIX C).
  The encoded samples follow immediately after the header.
  It's important to know this algorithm produces UNSIGNED sound, unlike
  the IMA ADPCM algorithm supplied here (see below). It is, however very
  simple to adapt both algorithms to produce either signed or unsigned
  sample output...

 SND2 chunk:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~
  It contains the 16 bit sound data compressed using the IMA ADPCM
  algorithm which compresses 16 bits into 4. That's why the SND2 chunks
  are 4 times smaller than SND0 chunks and they are used almost all
  the time. For the description of the algorithm, see later in the document.
  
  Different VQA versions have different stereo sample layout. In case
  of Tiberian Sun stereo sound is encoded the same way as mono except the
  SND2 chunk is split into two halfs. The first half contains the left channel
  sound and the second half contains the right channel. The layout of
  nibbles is as follows: LL LL LL LL LL ... RR RR RR RR RR.
  Old movies (C&C, RA) use a different layout. Here, the nibbles are packed
  together like this: LL RR LL RR LL RR ... This means that two left channel
  samples are packed into one byte and then two right channel samples are
  packed into another.

  Naturally, the size of a stereo SND2 chunk is exactly twice as big as
  a mono SND2.

  It is important to note that, when decoding, you have to keep separate 
  values of Index and Cur_Sample for each channel (see APPENDIX B).

VQFR chunk ("Vector Quantized FRame" ???):
~~~~~~~~~~
 A chunk that includes many nested sub-chunks which contain video data.
 It doesn't contain any data itself so the sub-chunks follow immediately
 after the VQFR chunk header.
 All following sub-chunks are nested inside a VQFR chunk. They can all
 contain '0' or 'Z' as the last byte of their ID.

 * If the last byte is '0' it means that the chunk data is uncompressed.
 * If the last byte is 'Z' it means that the data is compressed using
   Format80 compression. You can find its description in APPENDIX A.

CBF? chunk ("CodeBook, Full" ???):
~~~~~~~~~~~
 Lookup table containing the screen block data as an array
 of elements that each are BlockW*BlockH bytes long. It is always located
 in the data for the first frame. In Vector Quantization terminology
 these tables are called CODEBOOKS.

 There can be max. 0x0f00 of these elements (blocks) at any one time in 
 normal VQAs and 0xff00 in the hi-res VQAs (Red Alert 95 start movie) although
 I seriously doubt that so many blocks (0xff00 = 65280 blocks) would
 ever be used.

 The uncompressed version of these chunks ("CBF0") is used mainly in
 the original Command & Conquer, while the compressed version ("CBFZ")
 is used in C&C: Red Alert.

CBP? chunk ("CodeBook Part" ???):
~~~~~~~~~~~
 Like CBF?, but it contains a part of the lookup table, so to get the new
 complete table you need to append CBParts of these in frame order.
 Once you get the complete table and display the current frame, replace
 the old table with the new one.
 As in CBF? chunk, the uncompressed chunks are used in C&C and the compressed
 chunks are used in Red Alert.

 NOTE: If the chunks are CBFZ, first you need to append CBParts of them and
       then decompress the data, NOT decompress each chunk individually.

CPL? chunk ("Color PaLette" ???):
~~~~~~~~~~~
 The simplest one of all... Contains a palette for the VQA. It is an
 array of red, green and blue values (in that order, all have a size of
 1 byte). Seems that the values range from 0-255, but you should mask out
 the bits 6 and 7 to get the correct palette (VGA hardware uses only
 bits 0..5 anyway).

VPT? chunk: ("Vector Pointer Table" ???)
~~~~~~~~~~~
 This chunk contains the indexes into the block lookup table which contains
 the data to display the frame.
 The image blocks are called VECTORS in Vector Quantization terminology.

 These chunks are always compressed, but I guess the uncompressed ones
 can also be used (although this would lower the overall compression achieved).

 The size of this index table is (Width/BlockW)*(Height/BlockH)*2 bytes.

 Now, there is a catch: version 2 VQAs use a different layout of the
 index table than version 1 VQAs. I will first describe the version
 2 table format, as it's more common.

VERSION 2 INDEX TABLE LAYOUT:
 The index table is an array of CHARs and is split into 2 parts - the top
 half and the bottom half.

 Now, if you want to diplay the block at coordinates (in block units),
 say (bx,by) you should read two bytes from the table, one from the top
 and one from the bottom half:

  LoVal=Table[by*(Width/BlockW)+bx]
  HiVal=Table[(Width/BlockW)*(Height/BlockH)+by*(Width/BlockW)+bx]

 If HiVal=0x0f (0xff for the start movie of Red Alert 95) you should
 simply fill the block with color LoVal, otherwise you should copy
 the block with index number HiVal*256+LoVal from the lookup table.

 Do that for every block on the screen (remember, there are Width/BlockW
 blocks in the horizontal direction and Height/BlockH blocks in the vertical
 direction) and you've decoded your first frame!

 NOTE: I was unable to find an entry in the VQA header which determines
       whether 0x0f or 0xff is used in HiVal to signal that the block
       is of uniform color. I assume that the Wy entry of the header
       implies this: If BlockW=2 -> 0x0f is used, if BlockH=4 -> 0xff is used.

VERSION 1 INDEX TABLE LAYOUT:
 Here, the index table is simply an array of SHORTs written in normal, Intel
 byte order.

 The LoVal and HiVal are given as:

  LoVal=Table[(by*(Width/BlockW)+bx)*2]
  HiVal=Table[(by*(Width/BlockW)+bx)*2+1]

 If HiVal=0xff, the block is of uniform color which is (255-LoVal).
 Otherwise, write the block with index number (HiVal*256+LoVal)/8.

                         FORMAT80 COMPRESSION METHOD
                    by Vladan Bato (bat22@geocities.com)

There are several different commands, with different sizes : from 1 to 5 bytes.
The positions mentioned below always refer to the destination buffer (i.e.
the uncompressed image). The relative positions are relative to the current
position in the destination buffer, which is one byte beyond the last written
byte.

I will give some sample code at the end.

(1) 1 byte
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      | 1 | 0 |   |   |   |   |   |   |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
              \_______________________/
                         |
                       Count

      This one means : copy next Count bytes as is from Source to Dest.

(2) 2 bytes
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  | 0 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      \___________/\__________________________________________________/
            |                             |
         Count-3                    Relative Pos.

  This means copy Count bytes from Dest at Current Pos.-Rel. Pos. to
  Current position.
  Note that you have to add 3 to the number you find in the bits 4-6 of the
  first byte to obtain the Count.
  Note that if the Rel. Pos. is 1, that means repeat Count times the previous
  byte.

(3) 3 bytes
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   +---------------+---------------+
  | 1 | 1 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |               |               |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   +---------------+---------------+
          \_______________________/                  Pos
                     |
                 Count-3

  Copy Count bytes from Pos, where Pos is absolute from the start of the
  destination buffer. (Pos is a word, that means that the images can't be
  larger than 64K)

(4) 4 bytes
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   +-------+-------+  +-------+
  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |   |       |       |  |       |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   +-------+-------+  +-------+
                                            Count          Color

  Write Color Count times.
  (Count is a word, color is a byte)

(5) 5 bytes
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   +-------+-------+  +-------+-------+
  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |   |       |       |  |       |       |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   +-------+-------+  +-------+-------+
                                            Count               Pos

  Copy Count bytes from Dest. starting at Pos. Pos is absolute from the start
  of the Destination buffer.
  Both Count and Pos are words.

These are all the commands I found out. Maybe there are other ones, but I
haven't seen them yet.

All the images end with a 80h command.

To make things more clearer here's a piece of code that will uncompress the
image.

  DP = destination pointer
  SP = source pointer
  Source and Dest are the two buffers


  SP:=0;
  DP:=0;
  repeat
    Com:=Source[SP];
    inc(SP);
    b7:=Com shr 7;  {b7 is bit 7 of Com}
    case b7 of
      0 : begin  {copy command (2)}
            {Count is bits 4-6 + 3}
            Count:=(Com and $7F) shr 4 + 3;
            {Position is bits 0-3, with bits 0-7 of next byte}
            Posit:=(Com and $0F) shl 8+Source[SP];
            Inc(SP);
            {Starting pos=Cur pos. - calculated value}
            Posit:=DP-Posit;
            for i:=Posit to Posit+Count-1 do
            begin
              Dest[DP]:=Dest[i];
              Inc(DP);
            end;
          end;
      1 : begin
            {Check bit 6 of Com}
            b6:=(Com and $40) shr 6;
            case b6 of
              0 : begin  {Copy as is command (1)}
                    Count:=Com and $3F;  {mask 2 topmost bits}
                    if Count=0 then break; {EOF marker}
                    for i:=1 to Count do
                    begin
                      Dest[DP]:=Source[SP];
                      Inc(DP);
                      Inc(SP);
                    end;
                  end;
              1 : begin  {large copy, very large copy and fill commands}
                    {Count = (bits 0-5 of Com) +3}
                    {if Com=FEh then fill, if Com=FFh then very large copy}
                    Count:=Com and $3F;
                    if Count<$3E then {large copy (3)}
                    begin
                      Inc(Count,3);
                      {Next word = pos. from start of image}
                      Posit:=Word(Source[SP]);
                      Inc(SP,2);

Note that you won't be able to compile this code, because the typecasting
won't work. (But I'm sure you'll be able to fix it).

                          IMA ADPCM DECOMPRESSION

Note that the current sample value and index into the Step Table should
be initialized to 0 at the start and are maintained across the chunks
(see below).

============================
 3. IMA-ADPCM DECOMPRESSION
============================

It is the exact opposite of the above. It receives 4-bit codes in input
and produce 16-bit samples in output.

Again you have to mantain an Index into the Step Table an the current
sample value.

The tables used are the same as for compression.

Here's the code :

  Index:=0;
  Cur_Sample:=0;

  while there_is_more_data do
  begin
    Code:=Get_Next_Code;

    if (Code and $8) <> 0 then Sb:=1 else Sb:=0;
    Code:=Code and $7;
    {Separate the sign bit from the rest}

    Delta:=(Step_Table[Index]*Code) div 4 + Step_Table[Index] div 8;
    {The last one is to minimize errors}

    if Sb=1 then Delta:=-Delta;

    Cur_Sample:=Cur_Sample+Delta;
    if Cur_Sample>32767 then Cur_Sample:=32767
    else if Cur_Sample<-32768 then Cur_Sample:=-32768;

    Output_Sample(Cur_Sample);

    Index:=Index+Index_Adjust[Code];
    if Index<0 then Index:=0;
    if Index>88 the Index:=88;
  end;

Again, this can be done more efficiently (no need for multiplication).

The Get_Next_Code function should return the next 4-bit code. It must
extract it from the input buffer (note that two 4-bit codes are stored
in the same byte, the first one in the lower bits).

The Output_Sample function should write the signed 16-bit sample to the
output buffer.

====================================
2. WS ADPCM Decompression Algorithm
====================================

Each SND1 chunk may be decompressed independently of others. This lets you
implement seeking/skipping for WS ADPCM sounds (unlike IMA ADPCM ones).
But during the decompression of the given chunk a variable (CurSample) should
be maintained for this whole chunk:

SHORT CurSample;
BYTE  InputBuffer[InputBufferSize]; // input buffer containing the whole chunk
WORD  wSize, wOutSize; // Size and OutSize values from this chunk's header
BYTE  code;
CHAR  count; // this is a signed char!
WORD  i; // index into InputBuffer
WORD  input; // shifted input

if (wSize==wOutSize) // such chunks are NOT compressed
{
  for (i=0;i<wOutSize;i++)
      Output(InputBuffer[i]); // send to output stream
  return; // chunk is done!
}

// otherwise we need to decompress chunk

CurSample=0x80; // unsigned 8-bit
i=0;

// note that wOutSize value is crucial for decompression!

while (wOutSize>0) // until wOutSize is exhausted!
{
  input=InputBuffer[i++];
  input<<=2;
  code=HIBYTE(input);
  count=LOBYTE(input)>>2;
  switch (code) // parse code
  {
    case 2: // no compression...
	 if (count & 0x20)
	 {
	   count<<=3;		// here it's significant that (count) is signed:
	   CurSample+=count>>3; // the sign bit will be copied by these shifts!

	   Output((BYTE)CurSample);

	   wOutSize--; // one byte added to output
	 }
	 else // copy (count+1) bytes from input to output
	 {
	   for (count++;count>0;count--,wOutSize--,i++)
	       Output(InputBuffer[i]);
	   CurSample=InputBuffer[i-1]; // set (CurSample) to the last byte sent to output
	 }
	 break;
    case 1: // ADPCM 8-bit -> 4-bit
	 for (count++;count>0;count--) // decode (count+1) bytes
	 {
	   code=InputBuffer[i++];

	   CurSample+=WSTable4bit[(code & 0x0F)]; // lower nibble

	   CurSample=Clip8BitSample(CurSample);
	   Output((BYTE)CurSample);

	   CurSample+=WSTable4bit[(code >> 4)]; // higher nibble

	   CurSample=Clip8BitSample(CurSample);
	   Output((BYTE)CurSample);

	   wOutSize-=2; // two bytes added to output
	 }
	 break;
    case 0: // ADPCM 8-bit -> 2-bit
	 for (count++;count>0;count--) // decode (count+1) bytes
	 {
	   code=InputBuffer[i++];

	   CurSample+=WSTable2bit[(code & 0x03)]; // lower 2 bits

	   CurSample=Clip8BitSample(CurSample);
	   Output((BYTE)CurSample);

	   CurSample+=WSTable2bit[((code>>2) & 0x03)]; // lower middle 2 bits

	   CurSample=Clip8BitSample(CurSample);
	   Output((BYTE)CurSample);

	   CurSample+=WSTable2bit[((code>>4) & 0x03)]; // higher middle 2 bits

	   CurSample=Clip8BitSample(CurSample);
	   Output((BYTE)CurSample);

	   CurSample+=WSTable2bit[((code>>6) & 0x03)]; // higher 2 bits

	   CurSample=Clip8BitSample(CurSample);
	   Output((BYTE)CurSample);

	   wOutSize-=4; // 4 bytes sent to output
	 }
	 break;
    default: // just copy (CurSample) (count+1) times to output
	 for (count++;count>0;count--,wOutSize--)
	     Output((BYTE)CurSample);
  }
}

HIBYTE and LOBYTE are just higher and lower bytes of WORD:
#define HIBYTE(word) ((word) >> 8)
#define LOBYTE(word) ((word) & 0xFF)
Note that depending on your compiler you may need to use additional byte
separation in these defines, e.g. (((byte) >> 8) & 0xFF). The same holds for
4-bit and 2-bit nibble separation in the code above.

WSTable4bit and WSTable2bit are the delta tables given in the next section.

Output() is just a placeholder for any action you would like to perform for
decompressed sample value.

Clip8BitSample is quite evident:

SHORT Clip8BitSample(SHORT sample)
{
  if (sample>255)
     return 255;
  else if (sample<0)
     return 0;
  else
     return sample;
}

This algorithm is ONLY for mono 8-bit unsigned sound, as I've never seen any
other sound format used with WS ADPCM compression.

Of course, the decompression routine described above may be greatly
optimized.
